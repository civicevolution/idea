        %p This help page will show you how CivicEvolution helps you work together with other Skyline students to create a community written and supported plan for change in our community
        %p To get started, organize at least 3 other students to develop a proposal that answers four questions:
        %ul
          %li What is the change you want to make?
          %li Why is this important to your community?
          %li How can this change be made?
          %li Where do we start?
        %p 
          Your proposal should be compelling enough to inspire at least 10 other students to endorse it.  
          You can see the full checklist of criteria in the table of contents under
          %b Proposal checklist.
        %p As you'll notice below, each question is answered with a set of talking points. 
        %ul
          %li A talking point is a short sentence that clearly states a single idea to be considered, discussed and rated.
          %li Talking points capture the essence of your community’s conversations and ideas about each of the questions.
          %li Talking points are always displayed anonymously.
          %li Anyone can contribute a talking point to an existing proposal

          %li Creating a plan provides a constructive opportunity for community members to think together
          %li You do this by listening to others respectfully and reflecting on what they say and think.
          %li It is essential that everyone is invited to participate and that the planning process is completely transparent
          %li This ensures that all voices are heard and all perspectives are considered

        %h3 Here's how it works
        %ol
          %li CivicEvolution helps communities think together to create a broadly acceptable answer to a question
          %li 
            The answer to a question is expressed with a set of talking points like this:
            = image_tag 'vhelp1/example_talking_points_edu_print.gif'
          %li A group answers a question by creating, discussing, rating, editing and selecting talking points
          %li A talking point is a short sentence that clearly expresses a single idea relevant to answering the question
          %li Like the example above, each talking point conveys part of the answer
          %li Taken together, a carefully selected set of talking points outlines an answer
          %li Breaking the answer into small chunks makes it easier for people to discuss each idea and express their preferences through rating
          %li Anyone can add a talking point at any time
          %li Every important idea that comes up in the discussion should be captured as a talking point
          %li Talking points are always displayed anonymously, so it doesn't matter who enters it
          %li So, if you see a good idea in someone else's comment, feel free to add it as a talking point.
          %li Every talking point has a discussion area where you can ask questions, express your concerns, or suggest improvements
          %li Everyone should rate the acceptability of each talking point
          %li If you rate a talking point as unacceptable, we encourage you to share your concerns in a comment
          %li Every time you visit the website, we will display all the new talking points and comments added since your last visit
          %li Talking points can be edited by any recognized participant
          %li The edit should improve the talking point without changing its meaning
          %li The edit history is recorded so we can see how an idea has evolved
          %li In addition to rating the talking points, every participant is encouraged to maintain a list of their five most favorite talking points
          %li Just click the star next to a talking point to mark it as your favorite
          %li If you select more than five favorites, we'll show you a list of your favorites so you can adjust it
          %li The combination of ratings and favorites helps identify the most popular answers that are acceptable to most of the participants
          %li More advanced participants help select and maintain a list of the talking points that provide the best answer to the question
          %li Everyone can see all of the talking points as well as the selected talking points and discuss the choices that have been made on behalf of the group
          %li This selected set of talking points is the result of thinking together and serves as a community written answer to the question
