          #{link_to 'guidelines', help_path(:topic=>'Proposal_guidelines'), {:class=>"intro"}}.
          Basically, you have to work together with at least 3 other residents  to develop a proposal that answers four questions: 
        %ul
          %li What is the change you want to make?
          %li Why is this important to your community?
          %li How can this change be made?
          %li Where do we start?
        %p 
          Your proposal should be compelling enough to inspire at least 10 members of the community to endorse it.  
        %p 
          You can see the full checklist of criteria in the

      init_id: all
      title: What is a talking point
      haml: |
        %p Talking points are the basic building block for creating plans in CivicEvolution.
          
        %p Here is an example of a question and the four talking points that were selected as the answer.
        = image_tag 'vhelp1/example_talking_points_edu_print.gif'  

        %p 
          Talking points let us break down the answer into small chunks that make it easier for people to discuss each idea and
          express their preferences through rating. A group answers a question by creating, discussing, editing, rating and selecting talking points.
        
        %p So, what exactly is a talking point?
        %ul
          %li A talking point clearly expresses a single idea
          %li The idea helps to answer the question
          %li A talking point is a short sentence, less than 200 characters long
          
        %p 
          Here are a few examples of good and bad talking points for the question:
          %i What amenities should be included in the new park?
          
        %table{:border=>1}
          %tr
            %td The new park should have benches.
            %td Good form: short and clear
          %tr
            %td The new park should have benches and a dog run.
            %td Bad form: this is presenting two different options. How would you rate this if you only like part of the talking point?
          %tr
            %td Dogs aren't always friendly in a park setting, I don't think the owners pay enough attention.
            %td Bad form: this is a comment, not a clear idea that helps answer a question
          %tr 
            %td Trees are nice
            %td Bad form: this is an opinion and it is not clear how this clearly helps to answer the question
        
          
        %p What can you do with a talking point?
