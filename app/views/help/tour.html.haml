		%h3 How to organize ideas
		%ul.description
			%li Every project has at least one coordinator who is responsible for organizing ideas into related groups and writing descriptive themes for each group
			%li Everyone can review, discuss and challenge the theming done by the project coordinators to ensure that it reflects their collective views
		%h4 The steps for organizing ideas in the theming page
		%ol 
			%li Click the Question link/magnifying glass and then click the "Idea theming" tab
			%li Drag the ideas from the New ideas list on the left and drop them onto the green "Drop here" flags near the top
			%li You can create groups with one or more ideas each
			%li A lavender post-it will appear at the top of the group
			%li Mouse over the lavender post-it and click the pencil icon to edit the group's theme
			%li The theme will appear on the main proposal page
			%li The theme can be edited as often as necessary and ideas can be re-organized as often as necessary

		%h3 Meaningful answers
		%ul.description
			%li The coordinator arranges and edits the themes to create the meaningful answers displayed on the proposal page.
			%li The answers should be coherent and meaningful while reflecting and respecting the group's ideas and views so a new visitor understands the results of your group working together
			%li These descriptive themes are automatically transferred to the proposal pages so the theming page and proposal are always in sync

		%h3 Participants and coordinators
		%ul.description
			%li Anyone that signs up with CivicEvolution can participate
			%li The group of active participants should be representative of everyone affected by this project, not just people who agree with you
			%li Every project needs at least one coordinator to keep the proposal up-to-date by organizing the ideas and editing the themes
		-#%p.screenshot Theming page
		-#=image_tag('help/600/Theming-page.gif')
		%p.callout It is important for the coordinator to get the project off to a running start by contributing a few ideas to each of the questions and turning  those ideas into a theme for each question.
		%p.callout But remember, this is a collaborative effort and it is important that the coordinator doesn't independently do too much work too quickly. It is a judgement callâ€“provide enough information and liveliness to attract collaborators, but not so much that they feel their contributions are secondary.
		%p.callout If a team doesn't have an active project coordinator we will ask a project participant to volunteer

			%li CivicEvolution helps groups co-create an action plan
