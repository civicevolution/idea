		%li Each question in the proposal is answered by a hand selected set of talking points
		%li Anyone can suggest a talking point&mdash;a short sentence that clearly states a single idea
		%li The complete set of talking points is always available on the left side of the worksheet beneath each question
		%li Talking points are suggested, discussed, rated and refined to capture the essence of the participants' conversations and ideas about each of the questions
		%li But not all talking points need to be included in the final answerâ€“some may be duplicates and others may better express important ideas
		%li Trusted participants hand select a set of talking points to summarize the preferences of the group
		%li The summary should be true to the ratings and preferences expressed by the participants in the worksheet
		%li Participants can earn this trust by contributing regularly, discussing ideas with others and keeping their ratings and preferences up-to-date
		%li If the summary is out-of-date, it will be replaced by the top rated talking points
		
		
	%p Hand selecting the talking points can be done by clicking a question's link to display its worksheet

		%li Removing a talking point from the hand selected list will not delete it from the worksheet and you can drag it back onto the list if desired

		%li Remember, the hand selected list should be a true reflection of the ideas expressed  by the participants in the worksheet and not the bias of the editor
		%li The participants entrusted with selecting the summary should review the worksheet regularly to keep the list current and openly discuss questions and concerns with others
