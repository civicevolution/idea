 <h2 class="initTitle">Do you have an idea to make your community a better place to live?</h2>
<p class="initDesc">Propose your community changes through CivicEvolution. CivicEvolution is a website that helps citizens propose changes in their community</p>
<!--> <p class="initDesc">Whether you want to influence your community, your elected officials, or your club, you need more than a soundbite idea.</p>
<h3>Solution = Idea + Actionable Proposal + Community Support</h3>
 <p class="initDesc">CivicEvolution's process of structured dialogue leads participants through the steps
	necessary to develop an actionable proposal, solicit public feedback, and build community support.
	Within each step participants engage in a process of dialogue, brainstorming, 
 collaboration, and deliberation. Watch this video for more detail.</p>

<h2>Introduction to CivicEvolution</h2> -->

<h2>2029 and Beyond: Sustainable Future City Project</h2>
<p class="initDesc">CivicEvolution has partnered with the City of Geraldton-Greenough in Western Australia for their Sustainable Future City Project. Their mission is to develop a sustainable future city and region plan by and for the community. CivicEvolution is providing tools and processes for engaging citizen participants in deliberative collaboration to develop ideas and proposals for the sustainable community planning project.</p>

<h3>The 2029 project including CivicEvolution has been selected for the "short list" in the <a href="http://www.vitalizing-democracy.org/index.php?page=viewcompiler_shortlist&id_view=133&menucontext=37">Reinhard Mohn Prize competition</a></h3> 

<h2>We will listen to you</h2>
<p class="initDesc">When a government agency or decision-maker reaches out to their constituents they are making an implied promise: "We will listen to you." But how can they realistically satisfy their constituents? Nearly everybody thinks public engagement is a good idea, but no one knows how to do it well. Government agencies of all types struggle to find ways to engage their citizens in a constructive and productive manner while protecting themselves from unrealistic and off-topic demands. Clay Shirky's concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Everybody#Key_concepts" target="_blank" class="o">Promise, Bargain, Tool</a> leads us to a solution.</p>

<h2>Promise, bargain, process</h2>
<ul><li>Make a plausible promise that you can deliver</li>
	<li>Never make a promise without setting clear expectations for the participants (the bargain)</li>
	<li>Choose the tools and processes that will allow the participants to realistically meet expectations and claim your promise</li>
	</ul>
<p class="initDesc">If you want to engage your constituents constructively in making community policy, ask them to develop and review actionable proposals with demonstrable community support. CivicEvolution is an innovative approach that provides the tools and processes to empower citizens to brainstorm ideas, refine them into actionable proposals, review them and present them to decision makers.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p class="initDesc">The public brainstorms ideas. Teams form around promising ideas and develop the ideas by discussing and collaboratively answering a predefined set of questions that structure their work into a detailed, actionable proposal. As illustrated in this diagram, these proposals are the catalyst for constructive and collaborative community engagement between the citizens and the decision makers.  The public can read the team proposal questions and answers as it develops and provide feedback to the team. This feedback helps the team develop a better proposal with stronger community support and helps the decision-makers understand the public attitude toward the proposal as well.</p>

<h2>Democracy in action</h2>
<p class="initDesc">People with ideas that want to be heard now have the opportunity, and responsibility, to earn a hearing - in the court of public opinion and possibly before the decision-makers. Ideas and proposals illustrate their value through the team and public activity they engender. CivicEvolution avoids simplistic, anonymous internet ranking of ideas which is often gamed and can lead to unrealistic expectations for official response to soundbite ideas.</p>
<p class="initDesc">The unique structure and tools of CivicEvolution allow citizens to work together at their own pace and level of commitment, while clearly articulating the burden they bear for developing and promoting their proposals so they can compete in the marketplace of ideas that is democracy.</p>

<h2>Our plans</h2>
<p class="initDesc">CivicEvolution is pursuing additional sponsored engagements like the Sustainable Future City Project while simultaneously developing a grassroots public utility strategy that allows citizens to start their own proposals, build community support and get their proposals on the agenda. In addition to providing free citizen access to CivicEvolution, we will curate a collection of case studies and best practices. We hope to roll out a limited public version in August of 2010.
