	%h3 Come hear about successful public engagement from these local leaders:
 
	%p.presenter Terry Amsler Program Director, Collaborative Governance Initiative
	%p Terry Amsler is the Director of the Institute for Local Government’s Collaborative Governance Initiative. Situated in a broader program to enhance public confidence in government, the Collaborative Governance Initiative supports effective and inclusive public engagement in local decision making and helps local officials in cities and counties throughout California successfully navigate among the array of community engagement options that bring resident voice to the table on important issues.
 
	%p.presenter Ed Everett, City Manager of Redwood City, CA 
	%p Ed Everett has been the city manager of Redwood City since 1992. Prior to that, he served as city manager of Belmont, assistant county manager for Washoe County, Nevada, and program analyst/fire chief for the City of Palo Alto.
	%p After obtaining a degree in economics from U.C. Davis and a graduate degree in urban affairs from Princeton University, Ed gained valuable experience during several years as a VISTA volunteer. Today, while overseeing what some call the renaissance of Redwood City, he is focusing a great deal of research and study on the concept of ‘community building,’ what makes a real community, and how we achieve that in Redwood City.
 
	%p.presenter Dave Knapp, City Manager of Cupertino, CA
	%p City Manager David Knapp is a professional manager with 34 years of municipal experience appointed by the City Council - the equivalent to a Chief Executive Officer in the private sector. He is charged with implementing policy decisions made by the elected Council, which he accomplishes through delegation to appropriate departments. He is also responsible for preparation of the annual city budget consisting of an operating budget of $38 million and a capital improvement budget of $22 million. The City Manager supports programs that empower residents to "Build Community" in their neighborhoods, such as the Neighborhood Block Leaders program and Community Emergency Response Teams.
 
	%p.presenter Daniel Homsey, Director, Neighborhood Empowerment Network
	%p Daniel Homsey is the Director of the Neighborhood Empowerment Network (NEN), a coalition of residents and community organizations, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and private and government agencies.
	%p Previously Director of the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services (MONS), and now a member of the City Administrator’s team, Daniel is a third-generation San Franciscan who believes that neighborhoods are, and should be, the stewards of their sustainability.
 
	%p.presenter Pete Petersen, Executive Director, Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership/Common Sense California
	%p The Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership supports and promotes public participation as a way of developing more creative and sustainable policy decisions, and more engaged and informed citizens through consulting on projects, funding them through grant programs and relationships with concerned foundations, and promoting the ever-growing field of public engagement through training, writing, and public speaking.
