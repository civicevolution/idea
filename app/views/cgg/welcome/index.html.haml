	%h2.home_title How do we create a proposal for action?
	
	%p A proposal for action explains how your idea can be implemented by answering What, Why, Who and How.
	%p You will discuss, brainstorm, and answer these questions using this website, but first you'll need to recruit at least 3 other people to work with you. 	
	%p You'll also need to listen to the community for suggestions and to build support.
