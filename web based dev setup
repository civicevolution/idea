For remote web-based development, all I need is
	git
	ruby 1.8.6
	engineyard gem
	clone my repo


Install git and clone my repo

	Install git - requires expat
	
		wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files/expat/2.0.1/expat-2.0.1.tar.gz/download
		tar xzf expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
		cd expat-2.0.1
		./configure --prefix=/usr/local
		make
		sudo make install


		tar -xjf git-1.7.3.1.tar.bz2
		cd git-1.7.3.1

		./configure --prefix=/usr/local
		make
		sudo make install

		Alright, I have git installed, version 1.7.3.1

Install 30 day trial of textmate

I need ruby and rubygems running so I can use the engineyard gem to do control line deployment

	Install ruby - Ruby One-Click Installer for OSX
	http://rubyosx.rubyforge.org/

	If you want to install Ruby on Rails with the Ruby One-Click Installer for OSX, just type 'sudo gem install rails' in your Terminal.app after installation.
	
	/usr/local/bin/ruby --version 1.8.6

	Should I make /usr/bin/ruby point to /usr/local/bin/ruby

		sudo mv /usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ruby.1.8.2

		sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ruby
	

	Update gem
		 sudo gem update --system
		
		
	Install engineyard gem
		sudo gem install engineyard
		

clone ey recipes repo so I can create a new environment

	git clone git@github.com:civicevolution/ey-cloud-recipes.git


	So now I try to add user to postgres group in recipe

		execute "add-user-postgres-group" do
		  command "/usr/sbin/usermod -G #{user[:username]},postgres #{user[:username]}"
		  action :run
		end

	commit and push this to my recipes repo



Clone my actual code - I think it will need my pub ssh - it was already added to my account
	git clone git@github.com:civicevolution/civic.git


Create an environment and deploy to it with the updated chef recipe

	create a development environment with ruby 1.8.7
		Attach the new chef recipes to the environment
			/ce_development/Rails/ey-cloud-recipes briansullivan$ ey recipes upload -e development

	Boot as a single small instance

	attach civic app
		ce1.civicevolution.org
		ey rebuild -e development

	√ check postgres and brian groups


	Now I need to deploy the app w/o migration
		ey deploy -e development -a civic -r master --no-migrate

	Now deploy with migration
		ey deploy -e development -a civic -r master

	This worked

	Okay it all seems to work

	Take a snapshot of development
	
	Terminate development
	
	Reboot development from the snapshot
	
	
	Clone with snapshot doesn't attach chef recipes
	I need to upload and apply the recipes
	
			sudo monit restart mongrel -g
			
			after creating a clone from a snapshot, brian doesn't belong to postgres group
			
			upload and apply chef
			
			first just apply
			
			ey recipes apply -e development_clone
			

Notes:
	For older os x use
		ssh-agent /bin/bash
		ssh-add


	cat .ssh/config
		Host dev
		Hostname ce.civicevolution.org
		User brian

	dev ssh://brian@ec2-184-73-161-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	
	Master: ssh://brian@ec2-174-129-29-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	Master-db: ssh://brian@ec2-174-129-29-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com
